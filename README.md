## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Interactive Calendar:** Visualize your tasks on a monthly calendar view. Click on a task to see its details.

*   **Light/Dark Mode:** Switch between themes for a comfortable user experience.
*   **Responsive Design:** Works beautifully on desktop and mobile devices.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or later)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
*   [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
*   [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (optional, for easier repository creation)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ovinokurov/taskwise.git
    cd taskwise
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up the database:**
    *   Make sure your PostgreSQL server is running.
    *   Create a new database (e.g., `taskwise`).
    *   Create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the `.env.example` file.
    *   Update the `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env` file with your PostgreSQL connection string:
        ```env
        DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE?schema=public"
        ```
        (Replace `USER`, `PASSWORD`, `HOST`, `PORT`, and `DATABASE` with your credentials).
    *   Add your OpenAI API key to the `.env` file. The AI-powered features will not work without it.
        ```env
        OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
        ```

4.  **Run the database migration:**
    This will create the necessary tables in your database.
    ```bash
    npx prisma migrate dev
    ```

5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

The application should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
